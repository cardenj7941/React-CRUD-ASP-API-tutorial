React js CRUD Operations- Insert, Update, Delete and Retrieve are implemented with Asp.Net Core Web API from Scratch.

First of all, we build Web API in Asp.Net Core with SQL Server and Entity Framework. Defined DB Model with EF Code First Approach then
created Asp.Net Controller with web methods for CRUD Operations.

Created React App with create-react-app package. A Form is designed using Material-UI.
Implemented Validation per control as well as whole form. Web API is consumed during Form Submission and Retrieved
existing records once the app is rendered. For State Management we used Redux. Unlike previous react tutorials here we
created React component with React Hooks.

Points discussed :
- Build Web API in Asp.Net Core with CRUD web methods
- React Form Design with Material UI
- Implemented CRUD with Redux
- Enabled CORS in Web API
- Consume API web methods from React
- Real-Time Form Validation
- etc
